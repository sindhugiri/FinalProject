Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?
Option 2

IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:


* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.


* Why are you proposing this project?


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?


* What are your concerns about this proposal?


-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?
I will define a class called Movie.   


* What will that class take as input to its constructor?
Movie will accept a dictionary that represents a movie. 


* What will 1 instance of this class represent?
One instance of Movie will represent the rating of the movie.  


* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?

The 3 instance variables will be called rating, release date, and DVD release date. These instance variables will contain the string of name of the director, the string of name of the writer, the string of the name of the language, and the string of the names of the countries. This information is important because it will reveal additional information as to the 


* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:  

- What will the name of the method be?
The name of this method will be rating_info  

- What will the method do?
The method will provide the all the sources of the rating 

- Will it take any additional input? 
No

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It will return the ratings in the form of a list with all the sources being elements within the list. It won’t change anything about the instance variables.   

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
It is useful for this class definition because it provides additional information in terms of the where the rating on OMBD comes from. 


ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
This method will be called date_pair 

- What will the method do?
The method will pair the theatre release date and DVD release date. The theatre release date will be the key and the DVD release date will the value. 

- Will it take any additional input? 
No 

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It will return the pairing in the type of a dictionary. It won’t change anything about the instance. 

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
It is useful for the Movie class because connects two seemingly separate pieces of information together. 


[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?
The tables in my database file will be a Tweets table, a Users table, and a Movies table. 


* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
- text 
- tweet_id
- user_id
- time_posted
- retweets 
Users:
- user_id
- screen_name
- num_favs
- description
Movies: 
- title
- rating
- theatre release date 
- DVD release date 

* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")

1. Select all of the TEXT values of the tweets that are retweets of another account (i.e. have "RT" at the beginning of the tweet text). Save the FIRST ONE from that group of text values in the variable first_rt. Note that first_rt should contain a single string value, not a tuple.

2. Select all of the tweets (the full rows/tuples of information) that have been retweeted MORE than 2 times, and fetch them into the variable more_than_2_rts.


* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 




* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<




* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
